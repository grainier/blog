> “Trusted data beats big data every time.”

That line has guided much of my career—from hacking on **Siddhi CEP** internals at WSO2 to building distributed analytics at **Macrometa**.  
Today I’m starting this blog to capture the *why* behind those hacks, the edge-case bug hunts, and the architectural bets that paid off (or didn’t).

## Why another tech blog?

1. **Reference for future-me**  
   My notes sprawl across Notion pages, GitHub gists, and Slack snippets. A single public notebook forces me to tidy them up.

2. **Give back**  
   Nearly every breakthrough I’ve had began with someone’s generous blog post. Time to return the favor.

3. **Start conversations**  
   If you see a smarter way to tackle stream joins or fingerprint vectors, I want to hear it—PRs and comments welcome.

## What you’ll find here

- **Real-time & streaming:** Siddhi, Flink, Apache StreamPipes, latency war stories.  
- **Backend architecture:** Rust, Java, Python; observability, tracing, and fault tolerance tricks.  
- **AI agents & GenAI:** CrewAI / LangChain experiments, LLM-driven testing, prompt engineering.  
- **Data engineering:** ELT pipelines with Singer & Airbyte, data contracts, quality frameworks.  
- **Side quests:** Anomaly detection with River HSTs, crypto data hacks, DevOps lessons learned.

I’ll keep posts concise, code-heavy, and ruthlessly practical—something I’d bookmark for my next late-night debug session.

Thanks for stopping by. First technical deep dive coming soon!
