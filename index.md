Hi, I’m **Grainier Perera**—a principal software engineer, open-source contributor, and long-time tinkerer with backend systems.  
Over the last decade I’ve built **stream-processing runtimes (Siddhi, Apache StreamPipes)**, language features for **Ballerina**, and distributed analytics at **Macrometa**.  
This blog is my public notebook: concise write-ups of the things I keep re-googling, debugging, or just find too interesting **not** to document.

### What to expect

- **Real-time & streaming:** Siddhi, Flink, CEP patterns, latency war stories.  
- **Backend architecture:** Rust, Java, Python; microservices, observability, and reliability tricks.  
- **AI agents & GenAI:** LangChain / CrewAI experiments, LLM-powered test automation, prompt engineering.  
- **Data engineering:** ELT pipelines (Singer, Airbyte), data mesh musings, quality / contracts.  
- **Side quests:** Anomaly detection (River HSTs), crypto market data hacks, and the occasional DevOps rant.

### Why I’m writing

1. **Reference for future-me** – If I forget _why_ a design decision was made, there’s a post here.  
2. **Give back** – Most of my career was accelerated by open-source docs and blog posts. Time to reciprocate.  
3. **Start conversations** – Disagree? Have a better way? PRs and comments are welcome!
